# Business Socials Centralised Data Application

This project is a web application hosted on AWS using free-tier resources. It includes a React/Next.js frontend, a FastAPI or Node.js backend, and Terraform for infrastructure management. The application is integrated with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This application tackles the common issue of **missed notifications and fragmented communication** across multiple apps and devices. By consolidating messages, mentions, and notifications in one place, it ensures you never miss an important update or customer inquiry again.

## âœ… Key Benefits

- ðŸ“¥ Centralised dashboard for business social media and email accounts  
- ðŸš« Reduced reliance on error-prone mobile app notifications  
- âš¡ Increased productivity and responsiveness  
- ðŸ“Š Simplified monitoring and management of business interactions
